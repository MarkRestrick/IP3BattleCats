BATTLECATS
DEV DOCUMENTATION

|| V051		11/4/2017	Juha
=======================================
- Win animation added, plays with trigger Win in gameplayanimator
	- This should be set up since GPW
- ScreenFX blinking fixed





|| V049		8/4/2017	Juha
=======================================
- Animations updated & added to gameplay animator
- Cat shine fixed (material added on container cat models)
- Tap brightens earlier
- Slider background updated
- Level selection icons now blue
- Screen darkening on gameplay is now part of screenFX, should eliminate some lag
- New cat skins added, found in Resources

|| V049b	9/4/2017	Juha
=======================================
- Known bugs:
	- GameplayAnimator: Doesn't play bad animations (non-advancing)= laying down, buttwiggle etc.
	- Slim cat's feet go through floor. Unfixable, would need remodelling and rerigging the model
	- New cats have mirrored UVs, old texture maps might look weird, needs quite a lot work.
	( FIXED - ScreenFX blinks for unknown reason, probably tied to animator.)
	- Cat neck objects are clipping quite often in animations
		- would need some translate tuning for catnecklocatorobjects for all models
	- Eyes react to light weirdly, for unknown reason. Maybe related shader or lights.



|| V047		29/3/2017	Juha
=======================================

- Resources CatModels	(Containers in order of Pricing)
	CatContainer1	= Standard
	CatContainer2	= Slim

	* CatNeckObjectLocator, CatHeadObjectLocator, NameHolderObject, PhysCamera001.Target
		Added under each cat model
	* Runs GamePlayAnimator (which will be updated with rest of animations later)	
	* New cats do not have any assigned texture, but spawner handles this anyway?
	* Original CatContainer had CatPointerScript, but this is not added in new containers
	


|| V046		29/3/2017	Mark
=======================================
- All previous conflicts resolved
- Online user accounts created
- All details (Cats, skins, head items etc) stored online, retrieved on game launch for user
- Exitting store currently saves all options (Currency, unlocks, cat setups)
- User accounts persist between playthroughs

|| V044		25/3/2017	Juha
=======================================

- Old animator is now CatGameplayAnimator_OldBackup
- New one is copy of that, but plays animations as following
	All idles: Idle
	All non-moving: Jump

- Avatar change can also work for changing cat model, instead of prefab for everything.
- Updated target graphics and animations
- Updated main menu art
- Score has soft currency script, which should be replaced
- Feedback explosions changed to size 80 from 100 to help with screen clutter
- Darkening added to screen during gameplay, this will be combined to ScreenFX later, if it looks ok

	- score & perfect etc texts
	- buttons to go to menu, or replay
		- goes now to main menu room
		- there's some out-commented code to go directly to MainMenu difficulty from gameplay
			- MainMenuScript Start()
			- uses GameOptions object to carry over if returning from gameplay
	- all hits should be now shown or Perfects, misses on Misses with percentage on both
		- Misses calculation is now dodgy, should probably be int instead of float

- Friend room in main menu
	- choosing a friend activates another camera in RoomFriend gameobject
	- needs a cat!




|| V030		04/12/2016	Mark
=======================================
- Head/Collar items moved to resources folder, will now be called
when needed
	- Position/Rotation is messed up, can be seen by changing
	the values in the PlayGuestButtonScript, needs work to figure out
		- Might require a script per object to store the transform
		of each object as intended

|| V029		04/12/2016	Juha
=======================================
- New hold with distinct appearance, bit experimental graphicswise
	- Old prefab saved as ClickHoldBFingerBackup
- Play menu polished
- Main menu scaling should work now on devices

	- Prefabs\CatItems\



|| V028		03/12/2016	Mark
=======================================
- Performance Optimisation
	- All redundant calls in scripts removed
		- Every empty start/update method removed
		- Several redundant calls removed, but they're a lot harder to track down so probably
		still a few left
	- Graphics quality reduced across the board slightly
		- Less distinct shadows
		- No reflections (Don't think we were using them anyway?)
		- Texture resolution reduced
	- Debugging tools added
		- FPS counter
		- Cat spawner
		- In the main menu, but disabled within build


|| V027		01/12/2016 	Mark
=======================================
- Random challenger spawner implemented
	- Basically generates a random cat for the throne
- New cat implemented throughout the game
	- Eye/Eyelids adjustment
	- Animator fixes
- Minor game tweaks
	- Buttons are now slightly more generous with the perfect timing


|| V026		30/11/2016 	Juha
=======================================
- New stuff to use:
	- Cat Resized:	CatContainer (includes latest CatModelNS)
	- Cat Model:	CatModelNS
	- Animator:	CatGameplayAnimator
	- Neck items parented under: CatNeckObjectLocator
	- Head items parented under: CatHeadObjectLocator

- New cat model is smaller than earlies, and needs its parent to be scaled up 1.4 to match earlier cat

- New Animator logic. I will build better one on IP3, I have an idea for it, but this should do for now
	CatMovementTestScript:
        /* HOW ANIMATOR WORKS:
         * Currently the idea is that playerCatInspiration would push the animations on better tiers
         * 1-3 being Idles 1: uninterested cat, 2: medium, 3: interested
         * 11-13 Non-advancing actions with low player performance - i.e. player dropping in level sets
         * 21-23 Advancing actions with medium player performance - i.e. player staying at same level sets
         * 31-32 Advancing actions with good player performance - i.e. player going up in level sets
         * 
         * No matter how the numbers are formed, but animator will now follow these numbers.
         * After each movement cycle cat will return to similar catInterest idle. 1: uninterested, 2: sitting, 3: excited (buttwiggle atm)
         */

- Animator _should_ work, but this can really be tested when correct cat is spawned
	- if not, getting correct numbers at correct time will be the problem

- Blue and Pink room items prefabbed
	- BlueRoomFull and PinkRoomFull prefabs should be used for now instead of individual items

- GUI\Store\ folder has test images for cat skin store

- Menus have animated panels, hopefully they won't cause performance drops
	- UI scaling looks weird on my tablet, probably on phone too. I will adjust this later.



|| V025		29/11/2016 	Mark
=======================================
- Auto-Creating Store Expansion
	- Now works for head/collar items
	- Functionally identical to the skin system, just changed to accomodate
	collar/head items
	- Some mega palceholder stuff in to create the menus, you'll see when you click it
	- This still requires locator objects on the catobject in the resources folder
	before I can actually make the items physically equip, currently it just sets it
	up in the stablescript/inventory script, which the spawnscript will use to make 
	the magic happen
- Cat Spawner Tweaks
	- Now conditionally activates nameplates
		- Currently mainmenu bool = on, any other off
	- Bug fix where a cat being worked on by the store would permanently delete itself
- Running Game Fixes
	- Intro scoreboard now grabs the cat's name (RIP Mittens)
	- Level 8 sets recovered from v18 (Think we just sharded the project at some point,
	like this version of the changelog doesn't have the bit with Kristy adding stuff in)




|| V024		27/11/2016 	Mark
=======================================
- Auto-Creating Store
	- Looks in the resources folder for skins and for skin images
	then builds a panel ouf of what's there
	-Might need one folder per cat per section as it is currently, but it works
	-Currently takes one image (using the cat texture as a sprite currently) and
	one texture to make a button that can be clicked to purchase an unowned skin,
	or if it's owned equip it to the current cat
- Cat spawner can now delete the cat it spawns
	- Used to "refresh" the cat when a cosmetic change has occured (ie equipping a skin)
- Game no longer freaks out if you do too well
	- ie you can play it on hard and not have it crash after 2 sets
- Some holdover bug fixes (ie currency display uses the new system instead of the old one)

|| V023		26/11/2016 	Juha
=======================================
- LoadingScreenPanel prefab added under Prefabs\GUI\
	- Will fade in when activated, then loop flashing "Loading" text
	- Optional fade out with trigger "loadingScreenEnd"
- FadeInPanel prefab added
	- Automatically fades in from black screen
	- Has to be top panel in canvas
- CatModel's eyes parented again under bones, should get the spawned back to semi-fixed state (eyes not rotating still)
	- Spawner needs to load Prefabs\Actors\CatModel.prefab
	- This is the old one, as new skinned cat and animations need more mystery solving
- New cat animation fixes are worked mainly under ArtTest
- ScreenFX works now without destroying fps! Rebuilt as Sprites instead of UI images
- Ingame UI changed
	- Menu buttons toggled with "?" Button
- Tap button highlighted more on perfect



|| V022		24/11/2016	Mark
=======================================
- Spotlight/Camera now are childed under the cat prefab that is created in running level
- Each level with a cat spawn of any kind requires the main camera for that
	level to be tagged with the "LevelCam" tag, it's used to orient the text above them
- Cat spawned after the first one now no longer inherit the behaviour/attributes of the first
	one spawned in that scene
- Difficulty algorithm modified
	- Now takes into account if you aced two sections in a row
		- e.g. do well on first, go up one, do well on second, game recognises it and
		advances you up two levels instead of just one
- Start of the store button thing created
	- There's a game object in Resources/Store, that's what you want to save your panel to
	There's already a script to create one of them per object and then we just need a panel
	to assign them to in the main menu that has auto sorting on it

|| V021		20/11/2016	Mark
=======================================
- Old buttons are now properly on top of new ones (ie overlaps work)
	- Level set instantiates in reverse order now, meaning the first buttons are on
	the bottom in the canvas, and therefore on top
- Difficulty AI is in
- Code Tidyup
	- Most of the alerts in unity have been taken care of to get rid of that spam
	- Some legacy items from the very first prototypes removed
- Facebook integration
	- Currently not super functional, grabse facebook name and user id and stores them,
	but does not save them between plays
- All the presets are gone
	- All hail our illustrious new leader the cat spawner object
		- Make an empty object wherever you want the cat to be, attach CatSpawnerScript
		Set up the variables (Own Cat, friend cat, challenger cat etc) and what level it's in
		And then when that scene is loaded the appropriate cat will be loaded
- New player data hookup
	- Player data is stored in 3 (or 4?) scripts attached to a gamedataobject that is part of
	the splash screen, this data is used to create the player's cat at runtime
	tl;dr we can actually build cats instead of relying on one being made in the unity editor

|| V020		17/11/2016	Juha
=======================================
- SplashScreen added
- Main Menu with room
- MenuCamera is not really working, three versions of camera targeting tried
	- All of those are in the script commented out
	- Vector3 is fucked up for targeting
- Customize button opens side menu with Skin, Head and Neck buttons
	- Should also zoom camera CameraZoomToggle in MenuCamera's script
	- And when targeting works, aim at your cat
- Lights for MainMenu didn't load correctly when coming from SplashScreen
- Tutorial taken off for now, game goes directly to play



|| V019		13/11/2016	Juha
=======================================
- Canvas > ScreenFXPanel added for screen border combo effects
	- may cause performance issues, and needs testing
		- added button to toggle on/off
	- gets player combo from gamedata, changes it to float and sends to Animator on update
		- could be something more sophisticated which would send data to animator only
			when required combo is gained.
- Feedback explosion added
- Slider feedback is in correct rotation now
- Slider hit quality is required, now either perfect or bad

- Short Slider "ClickDragShort" prefab added
	- this one is with mouse aesthetics
- Octagonal Hold variant "ClickHoldOct" prefab added

- Cat's eyes fixed
- Cat movement options added
	- Now just randomizes between 1-3 idles and moves

!!! IMPORTANT
- Basic ClickHit and ClickHoldB prefab scale now 1.4 for testing purposes
	- Might fuck up levels, but needs to be tested for the small screen problem



|| V018		11/11/2016	Mark
=======================================
- Sliders now work (mostly) as they should in the final game
	- I need to find something more productive to do with my Friday nights

|| V017		10/11/2016	Mark
=======================================
- First pass on audio, BGM for menu/gameplay, audio for all game pieces, audio for 
	most, but not all menu buttons
- Medium difficulty added and turned on
- Had to mess with difficulty selection screen to add button for medium difficulty, as
	a result the anchors probably need to be fixed on that menu, didn't want to
	mess with it too much

|| V016		06/11/2016	Kristy
=======================================

- Mark helped fix dat bug oh shit waddup
	- Something about arrays not working properly so the difficulty wouldn't change
I don't know it's fixed anyway


|| V016		02/11/2016	Mark
=======================================
- NO MORE NESTED PREFAAAAAAAAAABS WOOOOOOO
	- Okay Seriously though
- Level sets are now defined in a LevelSetContainer script, attached to a GameObject and is
instantiated in the same way the previous nested prefabs were
	- I'm not actually sure why but it actually fixed a lot of the scaling issues

|| V015		30/10/2016	Mark
=======================================
- Some level sets fixes
	- All the drag ones weren't reporting properly, the feedback got muddled
- Cat walk fix
	- It's been broke since implementation, now is not (If statement fix)
- Cat now appropriately switches animations
	- Walks when moving, chills when... Chilling
- Game pieces now properly report global game stats to the data object
	- No more constant 0% success rate!
- Messed around with the currency text to make it display better



|| V014		30/10/2016	Juha
=======================================
- Added LevelIntroObject with animated camera, worldspace UI
	- Could be disabled if started from in game Dev restart
- Added countdown on main UI
- Slider speed adjusted back to 50 and target closing in circle speed increased
- Tutorial added to Mainmenu
	- Could have bool to state if the tutorial is watched once, needs to be in gameoptions
	- Only appears from Play, not from Challenge
- Adjusting on target animations

- Cat walk animation doesn't end
	- Needs to set animator "Walking" false when movement ends. Now it starts in CatMovementScript, but I didn't find placement for code to stop this

- Sliders are hard, and almost always break combo
	- Feels like they still do not have time to get to the end
	- Might be that the new object is slightly longer so speed 50 isn't enough for the time it's on screen


|| V013		28/10/2016	Mark
=======================================
!!!IMPORTANT!!!
- A dependancy has been created, a gameoptions object must exist in most scenes
	- Created in Main Menu scene, is never deleted
	- If testing a specific scene, you must manually create a game object,
	tag it as a GameOptions, and add the GameOptionsScript to it
!!!IMPORTANT!!!

- Game now ends after 6 sets have been played out
	- Awards money as if it was completed on normal, for Monday
	
- Cat Skin Customization in
	- Really ghetto menus in the customization screen
	- New script attached to gameoptions object, tracks unlocked skins and eqipped skin
	- Cat uses the selected skin on load
- Currency system implemented
	- Text objects added to main menu and customization screen to display current currency
		- Script attached to each of these to update them
		- Actual value stored in game options object
- Manually recreated most of the Level Sets
	-Couldn't import them as I'd hoped, had to manually redo, fuck my life :(


|| V012		27/10/2016	Juha
=======================================
- New slider: ClickDragHoriB
	- Old one is still there, and can be deleted when we're sure new one works
	- Graphics updated for the slider, needs fixing again
	- Doesn't score or get destroyed when at end
	- Lowered slider speed to 40 to get it closer to circle closing in speed
		- Doesn't have time to end track before destroyed because of this
- New hold: ClickHoldB
	- Should be working perfectly
	- Animation pauses when released
- Basic tap button got animation and graphics updates. Old prefabs should work as before.

- Set piece: SliderTest has now new pieces and it is set to Level 2 difficulty
- CAT MOVEMENT!
	- Sets animator boolean "Walking" true on CatMovementTestScript when gamemanager.Advance
	- Needs to set "Walking" false when movement ends
	- Yep, cat loses his eyes when walking. He has parenting issues. Will look into it more.
- Hat locator works. The CatHatCone object can be set inactive if it's annoying
- Added Friends screen with challenge leading to gameplay
	- going back from friends to menu goes to start of menu instead of friend list
	- quick and dirty again, will fix later
- Customize screen is copy of friend screen at, will work on later


|| V011		25/10/2016	Mark
=======================================
- Random difficulty gneration and selection implemented
- Goddamned slider hopefully fixed again >_<
	- Keeps losing the feedback object, the piece of crap


|| V010		24/10/2016	Mark
=======================================
- Feedback object applied to sliders
	- Applies inverse rotation to the object on activation (Otherwise the feedback comes up invisible etc)
- Minor timing tweaks to some of the objects

|| V009		23/10/2016	Mark
=======================================
- Three sets made for Monday
- Slider object tweaked slightly
	- Slide speed increased
	- Touch detection size increased
- Set size expanded to 10 seconds


|| V008		23/10/2016	Mark
=======================================
- I should fill this in as I work
- Weird scaling with prefabs instantiated in Canvas fixed
	- Scaling forced to 1 during instantiating
	- If something like this occurs in the future don't try to fix it, workarounds cause issues
	in this case the feedback text vanished when the scaling issue was fixed because it had been
	rigged to be way bigger to display with the bug, then going to nothingness when bug fixed
	- All the old prefabs for levels are hence broken, and we should really investigate a way
	to push hotfixes to all existing prefabs, preliminary research suggests it's not supported, which is troubling
	since we're currently so reliant on nested prefabs. Will be less of an issue when we finalise buttons I guess.
- Scoring system implemented
- Cat movement implemented
	-Not sure what to do when it gets to the end of the level, currently game continues and cat stays still
- UI in game updated to display relevant scores
- General fixes to clickables (ie slider speed, score modifications)


|| V007		22/10/2016	Juha
=======================================
- Hold feedback animation fixed, and more problems caused doing that
	- Original level section prefabs are now weirdly small, spawned at Scale 0.11~something
	- New level prefab Level2Test1 has all the feedback animations working
		- scale needs to be 10 for the prefab to look correct
			- this is rather awkward, seems to be related to 0.11 scale thing
	- Changed hold prefabs transforms to zero, they were before:
		* clickhold: pos x -7.26
		* holdbutton pos x 6.77 pos y -3.77
		- this caused feedback to spawn weirdly
- Badly coded main menu added
	- Customizing should probably be its own scene
	- Options and other stuff can be done as panels in MainMenu scene
- Test cat movement, camera, lighting, materials added
	- cat goes slowly between two checkpoints
- Slider had weird rotations and transform changes inside
	- changed now that everything is correct when the slider points right
	- rotating object for gameplay should be done byt changing Z on ClickDragHori
- Slider speed is super slow
	- probably related to scaling?
- !!!!! When new level prefab is made under GameManagerObject it needs to be Scale X1, Y1
		- when the prefab is ready it needs to have scale x10, y10
		- if the level prefab is adjusted under gamemanagerobject, it needs to be set again x1, y1
- scene GamePlay and MainMenu are the current ones
	- main menu script and button functions as component of Canvas


|| V003		21/10/2016	Mark
=======================================
- Multi-Touch input is now working as intended (Goddamn, finally)
- Game Manager system created
	- Sets of gamepieces are combined into prefabs (ie Level2Set1)
	- These prefabs are entered into the appropriate Array on the Game Manager object
	- Every X seconds (Arbitrary assignable value on the object) the Game Manager will generate a
	new section of play
	- Currently makes a new section every 4 seconds, each section takes about 3 seconds to complete
	- Most of the game piece prefabs (Click hit, hold, slide) had to be updated to use the new system,
	as far as I can tell currently it's all working correctly.
	- Currently restricted to level 2 difficulty (of 3)

|| V003		18/10/2016	Mark
=======================================
- Sliders Fixed - Speed variable (located inside Button child) was changed, may have been me when I was 
  messing around with stuff for V001
- Target circle set to child of the clickable button (Makes it follow it's active/inactive rules)
- Feedback prefab linked to ClickHits (Starts as inactive, is activated with either Good or Miss set to true)
	- Feedback object contains the kill command for the object, with an adjustable timer 
          (Moved from the button)
- Reorganised Scripts into relevant folders (was getting messy)
- Implemented Raycast detection for buttons (Basically ability to tell where someone has clicked/touched)
	- Slide and Hold objects now properly ensure the player keeps their fingers on the button



!! V002		17/10/2016	Juha
=======================================
- TestingScene_edit, is with latest changes
- InGameButtonScript controls the UI Canvas buttons Reload & Quit
	- This script is a component in Canvas > Canvas-buttons
- ModifySpeedUIVerScript controls the difficulty buttons
	- may not work correctly
	- uses public void SpeedChange OnClick() (in unity inspector)
- Added GamePanel under Canvas, GamePieces childed under this [is this the correct vocabulary btw] [Gotchu fam]
	- this may or may not be a reason for slider bug
	- this panel is to help scaling, might be unnecessary, but it would be good to have it, unless it causes problems
- Added Gameplay Layer for all gameplay elements
	- Camera renders only this layer
	- LevelCamera renders everything
	- UI Layer reserved for stuff which is not part of gameplay
- All code changes by Juha commented with //JS at the end of line for easier bug hunting :)
- ClickHit prefab now has TargetCircle prefab as a child
	- This gameobject holds the graphics, animations etc.
	- Is set active in code ObjectActivateScript
		- on update added: artObject.SetActive(true); //JS
		- may or may not be the reason for slider bug
			- hold and slider do not have yet art object attached
	- ClickHit button has now GotClicked OnClick() (inspector)
		- at the moment this doesn't do anything, hit is apparently registered with OnPointerDown?
	- ClickHit Sprite Renderer is inactive for default, may be set active for dev purposes. Should be inactive for actual game.

- ClickObjectScript has to instantiate HitFeedbackArt, see the script for comments
